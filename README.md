# Tic Tac Toe WoW Style
## Introduction

I have created a World of Warcraft Tic Tac Toe game with some fun art and being the ability to once more take the fight as either Horde or Alliance.

#

Technologies
============

This project is created in Javascript using the libraries:
- Jquery 3.6.0
- Animate.css 4.1.1
#

## How to play
#

You just need to load 
https://bissmark.github.io/project0-tictactoe/ 
into your web browser to play. Then you can start a 2 player version of Tic Tac Toe. When there is a draw or a win the score is increased for the winner and you can reset the board to play again.

## Features
#
It is pretty, it works and you get to play as Alliance or Horde in an epic battle!
#

<!-- ## Code

A commonly used variable in the browser is called `document`. See also: `window`, which also crops up a lot. jQuery uses the `$` variable.

```javascript
const  hey = function () {
    console.log('hello');
}
``` -->
